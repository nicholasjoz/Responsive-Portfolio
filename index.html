                <img class="nutella" src="./assets/images/nutella.jpg" alt="Photo of Nick Jay">Born and raised in Upstate New York, my life has been defined by the abject failures of my favorite sports team. I am a diehard Bills fan, and when your first memories of sports involve your team making the Super Bowl FOUR years in a row, (and losing each one), you get two feelings: <br> <br>
                1. Hey, sports can be cruel sometimes <br>
                2. At least we make it to the Super Bowl every year, so we'll get them next time! 
                <br>
			</p>
			<p>
               (Sidenote) Throw in the fact that my hometown receives the most snow and least sunshine in the country, and I have perfected a strongly sarcastic sense of humor to help make even the most dire of situations more enjoyable. This is a common tactic the inhabitants of Upstate New York rely upon as a shield against the harsh realities of everyday life. (/Sidenote)
            </p>
			<p>
                Throughout the mid-to-late 90's, the Bills made the playoffs 4 more times after their Super Bowl runs, capped off by the <a href="https://youtu.be/FCJFmL4oxPE">'Music City Miracle', </a> a disasterous last second loss in 1999 which I have blocked from my memory and do not want to talk about, thank you very much. :)
			</p>
			<p>
				And thus began the Buffalo Bills Playoff Drought, the longest for ANY team in ANY major professional sport. </p>
			<p>	
                During this drought, I graduated high school, graduated from Vassar College with honors (majoring in Film and Economics), moved to California, completed a Masters program in Finance at UC Santa Cruz, and moved to SF to begin work at Google in 2010. Then finally in 2017, after seven years at Google (five as Project Manager on the Youtube Team), the Bills finally made the playoffs- for the first time since the 90's - under the leadership of QB Tyrod Taylor. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Bills lost that game 10-3, failing to score a single touchdown. Shortly after the season ended, the Bills remembered they are the Bills, and have no right being good, so they promptly released QB Tyrod Taylor. They followed this up by trading away valuable 'draft capital' to 'move up' in the 2018 NFL Draft a select potentially-racist, highly inaccurate QB. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Shortly after the Bills' 2018 Draft debacle, Nick began classes at UC Berkeley's Full-Stack Web Developer Boot Camp, in an effort to learn coding and become a more effective Project/Program/Product Manager in the tech industry.
